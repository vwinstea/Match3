# Match3
Author: Vance Winstead

Completed: December 2018

### Description
This is the final project I created for my CS 112 class. It is written exclusively in java and makes use of Swing, AWT, custom exceptions, recursion, enumerations, and object-oriented design

### Rules
This game follows rules very similar to Candy Crush or Bejewled. Click on two ajacent tiles in order to swap their positions and match 3. The swap will not occur if a match doesn't occur. If there is 4 in a row, 5 in a row, or a match that is both horizontal and vertical, a special piece will form which will have a special effect on the board when matched.

Good Luck!
